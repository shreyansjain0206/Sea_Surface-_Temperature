    <section id="overview">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>In this project, we leveraged Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), a type of recurrent neural network, to understand and forecast the temporal dynamics of sea surface temperatures. Below, you'll find an in-depth analysis of the model's architecture, performance metrics, and a comparison with traditional models.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="model-architecture">
        <h2>Model Architecture</h2>
        <h1>Advantages of LSTM-based Neural Network</h1>
        <p>1. Sequential Learning: LSTMs capture sequential patterns, allowing the model to understand and predict the temporal dynamics of sea surface temperature.</p>
        <p>2. Variable-Length Sequences: LSTMs handle variable-length time series data, accommodating the varying time spans in sea surface temperature patterns.</p>
        <p>3. Feature Engineering: The model automatically learns relevant features from input sequences (e.g., Zonal Winds, Meridional Winds, Humidity), reducing the need for manual feature engineering.</p>
        <p>4. Scalability: LSTM architecture scales well with a large amount of historical data, enabling the model to capture complex and evolving patterns in sea surface temperature.</p>
        <p>5. Interpretability: Insights into temporal patterns and their impact on sea surface temperature can be gained through the examination of the sequence of LSTM states.</p>
        <h1>Disadvantages</h1>
        <p>1. Computational Complexity: Training LSTM models can be computationally expensive, especially with a large number of epochs and complex architectures.</p>
        <p>2. Hyperparameter Tuning: The model requires careful tuning of hyperparameters for optimal performance.</p>
        <p>3. Limited Interpretability: Interpreting the exact meaning of learned features can be challenging, hindering direct insights into physical processes.</p>

        <h2>Why Better Than Most</h2>
        <p>1. Temporal Dynamics: LSTMs excel in capturing long-term dependencies in sea surface temperature data, providing a better understanding of gradual changes and trends.</p>
        <p>2. Flexibility: The model can effectively handle various input features, adapting to changing patterns and offering versatility in modeling complex environmental interactions.</p>
        <p>3. Feature Learning: By automatically learning relevant features, the LSTM model minimizes the need for explicit feature engineering, especially in dynamic oceanic systems.</p>
        <p>4. Performance Metrics: The model achieves high-performance metrics, such as low Mean Squared Error (MSE) and high RÂ², indicating superior predictive capabilities compared to traditional models.</p>
        <p>5. Scalability: The LSTM model is designed to scale well with a large dataset, accommodating the diverse and evolving nature of sea surface temperature patterns.</p>
